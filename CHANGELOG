# TaskRunner

## 1.0.0 - unreleased

In progress...

## 1.0a3 - 2017-03-03

Third alpha version.

- Don't allow options to be passed via `-o` when there's a corresponding
  script option; being able to pass the same option via two different vectors
  seems like it could be confusing.
- Add `_overrides` option to `RawConfig`; simplifies updating a config object
  with overrides without needing to make a separate call to do the update.
- Add `RawConfig._clone(**overrides)` method.
- Improve output of `runtasks -l`, the condensed task listing. Use the current
  terminal width to format tasks into rows without mid-word wrapping.
- Show condensed task listing when no tasks are specified. The long task
  listing is really verbose and not that useful in this case.
- Add `-H` alias for `--hide` to main script.
- Standardize on `-E` for tasks that have and `echo` option  and `-H` for tasks
  that have a `hide` option. This also leaves `-h` available for task help.
- Use `-h` for task help. If a task has multiple H options, the first will get
  `-H` (unless the task also has a `hide` option) and the second won't get
  a short option name.
- Normalize task option names more by stripping dashes (after converting
  underscores to dashes) and lower-casing.

## 1.0a2 - 2017-03-02

Second alpha version.

- Attempt to fix buffering issues when running subprocesses via `LocalRunner`.
  I say "attempt" because this is pretty complex and hard to get just right.
- Allow arbitrary config options to passed via the command line via `-o`; these
  options take precedence over config set via config file.
- Improve (color) printer utility. Put the various color printing functions in
  a class and create a default instance of that class so that this instance can
  be imported instead of having to import the functions individually.
- Print warning, error, and debug messages to stderr by default.
- Make it easier to determine if stdout and/or stderr should be hidden by
  adding some utility class methods to the `Hide` enum.
- Only set the `hide` option for a task from the global config value if the
  task's default is `hide=None`. TODO: Something similar for `echo`, but that's
  a bit harder.
- Remove unused imports, clean other lint, add `__all__` lists where
  appropriate, etc.

## 1.0a1 - 2017-02-25
